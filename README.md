# Automated-Bottle-Cap-Sorter
This first-year uni project was done with the help of 3 other classmates: Dhyey Patel, Prerak Mahajan and Tanay Jain. As a team of 4, we built an automated bottle cap sorter. As we know, recycling has been quite an issue, and poor recycling habits have an effect on pollution, contamination, emissions of CO2. Therefore, we aimed to fix this environmental crisis by building this project and sorting plastic and metal bottle caps, a niche field, that still needs improvements in their sorting technology. Using an optical sensor, we were able to differentiate bottle caps by their reflectivity. Additionally, we were able to get more than an 80% success rate for every run (when the bottle cap goes through the entire system) *More information about the software, mechanical and overall design is in the report file.* Additionally, all code for this project was done in VEX CODE iQ in C++
